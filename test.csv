This is not selling, at first, but a way of legally using the telephone to record American officials and media figures, those who will be queried about declining tax revenues, especially in California, and why public sector officials cut budgets and endanger lives without privatization and self-governance empowerment and legislation. I sell advertising on websites that consult on minimizing tax liability through International tax shelters, domestic tax exemptions and deductions, affiliate commissions of software that process tax applications and for tax audit reviews in court.

Some of these officials are guilty of cover-ups, collusion, evidence tampering, and forced-beatings of suspects for stranger-abduction murders to justify major build-up in criminal justice system starting in 1993, that will be verified when I challenge the death sentence of an innocent inmate who has been released to the general population in San Quinton 3 times. You can buy a phone number from outside the country (U.S.), or I will buy it for you, to retain your privacy, but Canadian authorities will likely honor those who ""vex"" U.S. officials and journalists for non-disclosure of power-scams.

Are you coachable and teachable enough to qualify to Trade OUR money in the Financial Markets? We trade mainly Futures and Forex and we'll share with you why! WE take the risk and YOU keep 60% to 80% of the profits. We're a 10 year old company with Thousands of trader/members worldwide. You don't punch a time clock with us! The vast majority of our traders only trade 1 or 2 hrs/day, on their schedule, in the comfort of their home or office.

We will show you ACTUAL RESULTS from our traders! We will also show you our system in action. Most importantly, we will allow you to TRY OUR SYSTEM for a full 30 days, so you can experience it for yourself and qualify to trade our money!

You may not know that trading the Forex, Futures and Stock markets are making more Millionaires per year than any other business!

Have you ever wanted to learn to day trade but,

1) You don't know how to start
2) You lack the capital to invest
3) You thought trading was too risky

If so, you are certainly not alone. Most people cite these reasons for not attempting it.

We solved these issues by doing what NO ONE ELSE WOULD DO!

1) We will teach you, step-by-step, with an EXPERIENCED, SUCCESSFUL personal coach, trading with you and using our proprietary PREDICTIVE indicators. So, you will know exactly how to profitably trade with CONFIDENCE.

2) Once you are trained and qualified, we will FUND AN ACCOUNT FOR YOU WITH OUR COMPANY FUNDS, up to $100,000, so the income potential is exceptional!

3) We take ALL the risk. Even so, when you are profitable, YOU keep 60% to 80% of the profits. If you lose money (and practically everyone loses some as they are learning), you lose OUR money (which, by the way, you NEVER have to pay back). Naturally, since we both are interested in your success, we work hard to ensure that you don't lose money, but are consistently profitable.

Some may ask -- ""Why would your company do this?""

The reasons are simple: We have been doing this for years and have trained 1,000's of individuals, from a wide range of backgrounds, to trade our system. And, we have a very high retention rate! The reason for this is our very unique and highly accurate trading system. Our years of experience have proven that once our traders are taught how to use our proprietary system, they can and do trade very profitably, which benefits both them and us.

Finally, any experienced trader will tell you that one of the most critical aspects of trading is dealing with the FEAR and EMOTIONS of trading your own money, meaning, most traders can be successful ""practice"" trading (without real money) but, once they start trading with their own real money at risk, it's a ""whole different ball game"", which the vast majority of people cannot handle -- and they end up losing their money and quitting.

But, when they trade OUR money, the pressure is off and they can trade with much the same calmness and confidence as when they were practice trading. As they trade with our money, they keep most of the profits and we keep the lesser portion.

So, we have created a WIN-WIN-WIN scenario for everyone involved.

We have had great success with our traders, but we have LIMITED spots available.

Again, our traders come from virtually all backgrounds, so it really comes down to ""first come -- first-placed"". Time is of the essence, so fill out the application and we will be in touch with you.

https://trydaytrading.com/careers-toronto-finance/

This is not in any way an offer or solicitation for you to buy or sell any securities to or from us. All trading is done on dummy accounts to learn how to trade or done in the accounts of others who give you permission to make trades in their accounts, and not with your own money. We are not licensed to offer or purchase securities, and thus do not offer or solicit the sale or purchase of securities by you from us.    ",,$100-$300 daily

Full-time (38-42 hrs/week) and part-time (15-20 hrs/week) opportunities available Evenings, and weekend shifts availableCompetitive hourly wage with gratuity share 60% discount on all food  “It was a bold man that first ate an oyster” – and we’re sure glad he did. At Jake’s Grill and Oyster House, fresh oysters and seafood are our specialties. We’ve been serving the Burlington community since 1985, with no sign of stopping. Now, we’re looking for our next full-time dishwasher. As the newest member of our kitchen crew you can count on a few things: a stable  schedule, great working conditions, and being part of a close-knit team who truly enjoy working together. If that sounds like what you’ve been looking for, then look no further! Dishwasher:  As our new dishwasher, your main goal is to run and maintain our dishwashing area. You’ll play an important role on our team by ensuring our kitchen and front-of-house staff have the clean dishes and tools they need to keep our food service running smoothly. You’ll make sure all dishes, glassware, cookware, and utensils are cleaned and disinfected properly, and distributed appropriately throughout the kitchen and restaurant. When you’re not dishwashing, you’ll support our kitchen crew with basic food prep and portioning. You’ll also help us maintain a clean and safe restaurant environment by mopping, sweeping, cleaning equipment, and stocking restrooms.  The Right Fit: While some dishwashing or kitchen experience will prepare you for this role, we’re more concerned about who you are, rather than what you’ve done. Our best dishwashers share these qualities: Reliable – this is an important job – even the best tasting food wouldn’t look appetizing on a dirty dish. You’re someone we can count on to show up on time and do the job well, because you care. Organized – your strong organizational skills will allow you to keep up with a fast-pace of our busy restaurant. Team-oriented – you have a strong team spirit and are always willing to pitch in wherever you’re needed. Throughout your day, you’ll enjoy a lot of interaction with your crew, and you’re always looking out to see where and how you can help them. Independent –You’re able to take and follow directions well, and you thrive in an environment where you’re able to manage your work independently. Working at Jake’s Grill and Oyster House:  Almost half of our staff have worked with us for more than 5 years, and some have been with us for over 20! If you asked them why they love working here, they’d tell you that it all comes down to the people. Our management team is well organized, our team is friendly, and our regular clientele keep us busy. We’ve worked hard to build a culture we can be proud of. The Jake’s experience is defined by friendly faces, gracious service, a casual nautical atmosphere, the freshest ingredients, and a serious passion for hospitality.  We truly enjoy working here, and so will you. The Details:  This is a permanent position, offering both part-time and full-time opportunities. We have daytime and evening shifts available. Day time shifts run from 8 am - 4 pm, and evening shifts are 5 pm - 11 pm.  You’ll be paid a competitive hourly wage and will also receive an above-industry standard gratuity share. You’ll also receive a 60% discount on all food! Qualifications: The major requirement for this position is your ability to:Lift up to 30 lbs regularly throughout an 8-hour shiftStand for the duration of your 8-hour shift (with regular breaks) The following experience would be a big asset, but is not required:Experience working in a restaurant kitchenExperience working as a dishwasher in a restaurant/food service environment How to Apply: Our online application will give you the option to apply to this role as a complete person – not just a resume. The application will assess your qualifications, personality traits and workplace preferences, and should take 10 to 15 minutes to complete. After submitting, you'll receive an email inviting you to log in and view your assessment results. We value diversity and inclusion and encourage all qualified people to apply.

GOOGLE IS DRIVING CHANGE
Google has a stated goal of making the web more secure by requiring a
secure connection between a site and its users.
They are slowly rolling out a series of changes to their browser, which will
throw up flags and notifications that a connection is not secure.
Right now there are just a soft warning showing the site is not secure. Later,
they will start implementing hard-stop warnings, which pause the user
experience of site visitors, and block sites altogether.
They’ll also add warning signs to any web forms, where people enter
private information such as telephone numbers, passwords and emails
addresses.
These warnings will be rolled-out in future updates to Chrome, so as time
passes, the effect this will have on website traffic and offer conversions will
become more pronounced unless security is added. In fact, Google had to
slow down these changes because 90% of all websites do not offer a secure site.
We supply and install SSL certificates on all websites. This is an easy sell and excellent commissions can be made.
